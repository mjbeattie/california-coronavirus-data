## About the data

These files come from a continual Times survey of California's 58 county health agencies and three city agencies. Updated numbers are published throughout the day at [latimes.com/coronavirustracker](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/). This repository will periodically update with an extract of that data.

The figures are typically ahead of the totals compiled by California's Department of Public Health. By polling local agencies, The Times database also gathers some information not provided by the state. The system has [won praise](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1243329930877788160) from public health officials, who do not dispute its method of data collection.

The tallies here are mostly limited to residents of California, the standard method used to count patients by the stateâ€™s health authorities. Those totals do not include people from other states who are quarantined in California, such as the passengers and crew of the Grand Princess cruise ship that docked in Oakland.

## Data dictionary

### [latimes-agency-totals.csv](./latimes-agency-totals.csv)

The total cases and deaths logged by local public health agencies each day. Each row contains the cumulative totals reported by a single agency as of that date.

Most counties have only one agency except for Alameda and Los Angeles counties, where some cities run independent health departments. In Alameda County, the city of Berkeley is managed independently. In Los Angeles County, Pasadena and Long Beach are managed independently. These cities' totals are broken out into separate rows. In order to calculate county-level totals, you must aggregate them together using the `county` field.

### [latimes-county-totals.csv](./latimes-county-totals.csv)

The county-level totals of cases and deaths logged by local public health agencies each day. This is a derived table. Each row contains the aggregation of all local agency reports in that county logged by Los Angeles Times reporters and editors in `latimes-agency-totals.csv`.

It comes with all of the same caveats as its source. It is included here as a convenience.

### [latimes-agency-websites.csv](./latimes-agency-websites.csv)

| field    | type   | description                                                 |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agency` | string | The name of the county or city public health agency.        |
| `url`    | string | The location of the agency's website on the World Wide Web. |

### [latimes-place-totals.csv](./latimes-place-totals.csv)

Some counties, primarily in Southern California, break out the location of cases within their service area. The Times is gathering and consolidating these lists. Each row contains cumulative case totals reported in that area as of that date.

The following counties currently do not report cases by locality: Alpine, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Inyo, Lake, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Modoc, San Benito, San Mateo, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tuolumne and Yuba

Some counties provide data by region. The locations provided by Los Angeles County correspond to the public health department's official "Countywide Statistical Areas". Locations in other counties are manually geocoded by The Times. San Francisco and Imperial counties provide data at the ZIP Code level.

Be aware that some counties have shifted the place names used over time.

In some circumstances the true total of cases is obscured. Los Angeles and Orange counties decline to provide the precise number of cases in areas with low populations and instead provide a potential range. The lowest number in the range is entered into the record in the `confirmed_cases` field and an accompanying `note` includes the set of possible values.

### [cdph-state-totals.csv](./cdph-state-totals.csv)

Totals published by the California Department of Public Health in [its daily press releases](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx). Each row contains all numbers included in that day's release.

This file includes cases and deaths, the age of victims, transmission types, tests and hospitalizations. The state has stopped supplying some fields and began supplying some others over time. Deprecated fields have been maintained in this file and are noted below.

Due to bureaucratic lags, the state's totals for cases and deaths arrive slower than The Times numbers, which are generated by surveying local agencies. The state's methods for collecting testing data have struggled with [errors](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-04/gavin-newsom-california-coronavirus-testing-task-force) and [delays](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-30/its-taking-up-to-eight-days-to-get-coronavirus-tests-results-heres-why).

Some dates are missing because the state did not publish a press release for that day.
